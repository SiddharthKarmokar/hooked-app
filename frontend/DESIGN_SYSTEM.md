# HookED UI/UX Update Documentation

## Overview
This document summarizes the UI/UX changes made to the HookED React Native application according to the new design specification. The update focused on implementing a consistent design system, creating reusable components, and applying the new styles to key screens in the application.

## Theme Configuration

The new theme has been defined in `/src/styles/theme.ts` with the following key elements:

### Color Palette
```javascript
export const colors = {
  navy: '#0E1E49',          // Dark navy for text and logo
  orange: '#FF5D33',        // Bright orange for buttons and accent
  blue: '#3165FF',          // Royal blue for buttons in alternating pattern
  cream: '#FAFAFA',         // Off-white/cream background
  white: '#FFFFFF',         // White for cards
  lightGray: '#F5F5F5',     // Light gray for search bar
  // ...additional colors
}
```

### Typography
```javascript
export const typography = {
  fonts: {
    regular: 'System',
    medium: 'System',
    semiBold: 'System',
    bold: 'System',
  },
  sizes: {
    extraLarge: 32,
    large: 24,
    medium: 20,
    regular: 16,
    small: 14,
    tiny: 12,
  },
  weights: {
    regular: '400',
    medium: '500',
    semiBold: '600',
    bold: '700',
  },
}
```

### Spacing and Sizing
```javascript
export const spacing = {
  xs: 4,
  s: 8,
  m: 16,
  l: 24,
  xl: 32,
  xxl: 48,
}

export const borderRadius = {
  buttonRadius: 24,
  cardRadius: 16,
  searchRadius: 24,
}
```

## Reusable Components

We've implemented the following reusable components in `/src/components/StyledComponents.tsx`:

1. **Layout Components:**
   - `Container`: Basic layout container with consistent padding and background
   - `Heading`: Large text for main screen titles
   - `Subheading`: Smaller text for section titles or descriptions

2. **Button Components:**
   - `BlueButton`: Primary blue button with consistent styling
   - `OrangeButton`: Secondary orange button with consistent styling

3. **Input Components:**
   - `SearchBar`: Consistent search input field with icon

4. **Content Components:**
   - `Card`: Standardized content card for displaying hook information
   - `XpCounter`: XP (experience points) counter for the user
   - `DailyButton`: Button for daily activities

## Logo Component

We've created a reusable `Logo` component in `/src/components/Logo.tsx` that can be used across the app with configurable size and optional tagline.

## Screen Implementations

We've updated the following screens:

1. **SplashScreen:**
   - Created a new splash screen with the app logo and animation
   - Located at `/src/screens/SplashScreen.tsx`

2. **OnboardingScreen:**
   - Updated the interest selection grid with new styling
   - Added consistent typography and spacing
   - Located at `/src/screens/OnboardingScreen.tsx`

3. **HomeScreen:**
   - Implemented with the new component system
   - Features search bar, stats row, and content cards
   - Uses placeholder images for content
   - Located at `/src/screens/HomeScreen.tsx`

4. **HookDetailScreen:**
   - Partially updated with new theme
   - Will need further refinement

## Navigation Updates

We've updated `AppNavigator.tsx` to include the SplashScreen in the navigation flow and added a new Home tab in the bottom tab navigator.

## Placeholder Images

Since we can't generate actual images, we've created a placeholder component in `/src/assets/images/placeholder.tsx` that renders a colored rectangle for demo purposes.

## Next Steps

The following tasks remain to be completed:

1. **Complete the remaining screens:**
   - Update HookFeedScreen styling with new styled components
   - Update HookDetailScreen with new styled components, particularly the action buttons
   - Ensure correct handling of React Native type errors when updating typography styles

2. **Finalize component library:**
   - Add additional components as needed
   - Ensure proper documentation for all components

3. **Testing:**
   - Test the app on different screen sizes
   - Verify that all UI elements respond correctly to user interactions

## Known Issues

1. **TypeScript Font Weight Errors:**
   There are TypeScript errors related to font weight types in some components. To fix these:
   
   ```typescript
   // In theme.ts, update the font weights to use TypeScript's FontWeight type:
   
   weights: {
     regular: '400' as FontWeight,
     medium: '500' as FontWeight, 
     semiBold: '600' as FontWeight,
     bold: '700' as FontWeight,
   }
   
   // And import the type:
   import { TextStyle } from 'react-native';
   type FontWeight = TextStyle['fontWeight'];
   ```

2. **Missing Color Properties:**
   Some components reference color properties that don't exist in the updated theme (like `colors.alert`). 
   These should be updated to use the appropriate colors from the new theme.

## Conclusion

The UI/UX update has established a solid foundation for the HookED application with a consistent design system, reusable components, and updated screens. The new design creates a more modern, engaging user experience that should improve user satisfaction and retention.
